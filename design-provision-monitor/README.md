# Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

In this project, you will plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

  Exercise_1:

  - AWS as the cloud provider
  - Use an existing VPC ID
  - Use an existing public subnet
  - 4 AWS t2.micro EC2 instances named Udacity T2
  - 2 m4.large EC2 instances named Udacity M4

  Exercise_2: write the code to deploy an AWS Lambda Function
